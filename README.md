## 6 KEY QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWERS
- What are the top 15 shipments by state			
- Which Product category has the highest sales			
- Estimated Total sales by states			
- Top ten states with highest profit			
- Product with the highest purchase

## KPI
The Key Performing Index that we will be looking at are;
- Total profit	
- Total sales	 
- Average profit	 
- average sales	 
- sales that make up total profit	12%

We calculate the total profit and total sales by applying the **SUM** function on the respective column. Total profit gave **$286,324.07** and total sales gave **$2,296,957.70**.

We calculate average profit and average sales by applying the average function on the respective column. Average profit gave **$28.65**, while average sales gave **$229.86**.

Finally we calculate the percentage of sales that make up the total profit by dividing total profit by total sales and multiplying the result by 100, which result to **12%**.

## SOLUTION TO QUESTIONS ASKED

The solutions are provided using a pivot table and illustrated graphically on a pivot chart.

## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

The analysis shows that most sales,profit and also shipment was recorded in California. The data also showed areas were massive loss in profit for some items were recorded. Technology and consumer products generated so much sales. Most customers prefered their items shipped with the standard class shipment option. The item 'Binders' from office supplies had the greatest percentage of items purchased. As a result of this data, it can be deduced that the state **California** contributed about **19.92%** of total sales, and **North Dakota** having the lowest of 0.04%. The following recommendations are advised

- More campaings and adverts be carried out in states with very poor sales
- Poducts in corporate and home office category be given a sales boost
- Product and sales that recorded huge loss should be investigated and made sure such losses dont re-occur
- Ads,campaign including suggestions and discount should be given to customers to be open to **SAME DAY** shipping option, which recorded very low on customers preferrence
