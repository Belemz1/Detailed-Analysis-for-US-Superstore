## KPI
The Key Performing Index that we will be looking at are;
- Total profit	
- Total sales	 
- Average profit	 
- average sales	 
- sales that make up total profit	12%

We calculate the total profit and total sales by applying the **SUM** function on the respective column. Total profit gave **$286,324.07** and total sales gave **$2,296,957.70**.

We calculate average profit and average sales by applying the average function on the respective column. Average profit gave **$28.65**, while average sales gave **$229.86**.

Finally we calculate the percentage of sales that make up the total profit by dividing total profit by total sales and multiplying the result by 100, which result to **12%**.
